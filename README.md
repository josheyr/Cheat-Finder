# Cheat-Finder
First forensic analysis tool for finding cheats (old - 2017ish)

One of my first C# programs about 4-5 years ago, it's very badly coded but I've been programming since so gained a lot of experience. I now own and develop a major cheat finding tool with thousands of active users in my spare time.
